# Security Policy

## Introduction

This security policy outlines how to report and handle security vulnerabilities in our project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please email us at [openwayne@gmail.com](mailto:openwayne@gmail.com) with the details. To protect our users, we request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been addressed.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any relevant logs or screenshots
- Your contact information (optional)

We will acknowledge your report within 7 days and provide a preliminary response.

## Response Process

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report within 7 days.
2. Assess the severity and impact of the vulnerability.
3. Develop and test a fix.
4. Release a security update once the vulnerability is fixed.
5. If necessary, issue a security advisory to inform users.

We aim to address all critical vulnerabilities within 30 days. If a fix takes longer, we will provide updates on the progress to the reporter.

## Security Advisories

We will publish all security advisories on the [project's releases page](https://github.com/antvis/F6/releases). Please check this page regularly to ensure your version is up-to-date and secure.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that all reporters practice responsible disclosure by not publicly disclosing vulnerability details until a fix has been made. We believe responsible disclosure helps ensure the safety of our users while giving the development team adequate time to address the issue.
